<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The reading section</h2>



<p>There are three passages (total 20*3 = 40 questions) in the IELTS Reading test. You will have a total of 60 minutes to complete this reading section.</p>



<p>You MUST write your answers quickly and directly on the answer sheet because there will be no extra time for transferring your answers to the sheet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The content</h2>



<p>For IELTS academic tests: the texts are about academic subjects taken from books or journals. Its knowledge will not be too specialized but not too simple.</p>



<p>For the <a href="https://takeielts.britishcouncil.org/take-ielts/prepare/test-format">IELTS General test</a>: the texts are likely informal and close to daily life such as leaflets and magazines. It uses more familiar words rather than academic ones.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reading tips</h2>



<ul>
<li>Use your time effectively. Donâ€™t spend too much time solving a question (you should move on if it took more than 3 minutes)</li>



<li>DO NOT read the entire passage. Read the title, and subtitle of the passage to have a quick general look at the passage.</li>



<li>Focus on what the question asks, and <a href="https://ieltshappy.com/reading/">what types of them</a> and use skimming and scanning techniques to answer them.</li>



<li>Do the questions which ask about detailed information FIRST, and do the questions which ask general summary LAST.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Skimming</h2>



<p>Imagine you are going to buy a newspaper at the shop. You cannot read the entire content of it to decide whether to buy or not.</p>



<p>Skimming is to understand the general meaning of the text, you should read a newspaper quickly every day to practice skimming.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.oberlo.com/media/1612639204-image3.jpg?fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;w=1824" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Reading the first paragraph and the last one carefully will give you a general look at what the entire passage is about.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Scanning</h2>



<p>Scanning happens when you have read the questions, and you are finding where the answer locates in the passage to solve it.</p>



<p>Most of the time, your eyes have to look through all the texts to find the keywords. There are 3 effective ways to perform this:</p>



<ul>
<li>Scan a zig-zag line from left to right of a line, then the next line you start from right to left, and the next line you left to right again.</li>



<li>Scan from right to left: quickly move your eyes from the right of a line to the left of it to look for keywords and repeat for the next line.</li>



<li>If you feel uncomfortable, feel free to perform scanning naturally, most people will scan from left to right for every line and it works.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vocabulary</h2>



<p>The questions and the answers sometimes will be paraphrased to test your vocabulary and whether you understand it or not.</p>



<p>This usually happens in the TRUE/FALSE/NOT GIVEN question types and Matching headings also. Sometimes new words will distract you.</p>



<p>If the new words are useless (meaning you donâ€™t need them to answer the question), forget them. Otherwise, look at the context of it.</p>



<p>You can easily guess the meaning of the word based on the surrounding words, or you can see what is its prefixes, suffixes, and root word.</p>



<p>The last piece of advice: learn vocabulary every day! If you learn about 10 to 20 words per day, you can easily answer the questions.</p>
